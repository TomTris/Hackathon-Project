The implementation is another Idea. We unfortunately couldn't finish it.

And below are ideas for INTMAX sponsor!!
These are solutions that i can give. Hopefully it can contribute even just a little.

1.0: Transaction Mixing

if the system can mix transactions, which means that your transaction gets combined with others. This obscures the trail and makes it hard to determine which transaction belongs to which user.

1.1: User Identity Protection:

using advanced cryptographic techniques that prevent anyone from linking transactions to the real identity. This means if someone even sees your transaction on the blockchain, they cannot tell who you are or which wallet belongs to you

1.2:  One-Time Addresses - generates unique addresses for each transaction. This means each time you receive funds, a new address is created, making it difficult for anyone to track your walletâ€™s activity over time.

2.0  Using Lelantus: which enables private transactions. Users can burn coins to receive anonymous receipts, allowing them to redeem or transfer coins without revealing their amounts or transaction history. This method is a kind of zero-knowledge proofs, but ensures high anonymity while maintaining efficiency..

Thank you.
