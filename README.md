The implementation is another Idea. We unfortunately couldn't finish it.

And below are ideas for INTMAX sponsor!!
These are solutions that i can give. Hopefully it can contribute even just a little.
1.0: Transaction Mixing
if the system can mix transactions, which means that your transaction gets combined with others. This obscures the trail and makes it hard to determine which transaction belongs to which user.
1.1: User Identity Protection:
using advanced cryptographic techniques that prevent anyone from linking transactions to your real identity. This means even if someone sees your transaction on the blockchain, they cannot tell who you are or which wallet belongs to you
1.2 Create millions or billions of anonymous accounts. When you withdraw, the system randomly picks one, ensuring your identity stays private and transactions remain untraceable.
1.3:  One-Time Addresses - generates unique addresses for each transaction, so when we receive funds, a new address is created, which make it difficult for anyone to track your walletâ€™s activity over time.
1.4  unique privacy protocol called Lelantus and its enhanced version, Lelantus Spark, to enable private transactions. Users can burn coins to receive anonymous receipts, allowing them to redeem or transfer coins without revealing their amounts or transaction history, which uses zero-knowledge proofs at a higher level, ensuring high anonymity while maintaining efficiency.

Thank you.
